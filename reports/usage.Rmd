## Introduction

The HexScape package has a number of uses:

1. Facilitate use of vectorised spatial data for EU/EEA countries, and/or regions/areas (as defined by NUTS1/2/3) of these countries

2. Facilitate use of additional vectorised spatial data on parishes, kommune and postcodes for Denmark

3. Subdivision of the above spatial data into `patches' based on either polygons of arbitrary size, or Voronoi tessellation around points of interest supplied by the user

4. Facilitate use of Corine land usage data for EU/EEA countries (or regions/areas thereof) and aggregation of different land cover types within the spatial areas and/or patches defined above

The data comes from a combination of Eurostat, Corine, and other sources - all of which is freely available online.  Much of the internal functionality is provided by the sf package.


## Installation

The package isn't on CRAN (yet?), but the most recent stable (ish) version can be installed from our drat repository using:

```{r eval=FALSE}

```

Or, for the most recent (but even less stable) version you can install from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}

```

Then you should be able to load the package:

```{r}
library("HexScape")
```

Note that this also currently loads tidyverse, as that is what I used to develop the package, and I was too lazy to import everything properly. At some point, this will change, so it is probably best to explicitly load tidyverse as well:

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

(Unless of course you don't use tidyverse, in which case you should probably read https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html a couple more times)


## Setup

The HexScape package makes heavy use of local caching, as most of the spatial operations take quite a long time to process.  So, the first step is to create a folder somewhere on your hard drive (NOT a network storage drive) to/from which files can be saved/loaded. Then run the following code:

```{r echo=FALSE}
path_to_folder <- tempdir()
```

```{r}
set_storage_folder(path_to_folder)
```

You should now see that HexScape has created some subfolders:

```{r}
list.files(path_to_folder)
```

This storage folder needs to be set every time you load HexScape.  To avoid having to do this manually, you can put the following code in your .Rprofile:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## To open your .Rprofile try:
usethis::edit_r_profile()

## Then add the following to the bottom of that file:
Sys.setenv("HEXSCAPE_STORAGE"="/path/to/folder")
# [obviously replacing /path/to/folder with your path]
```

That way, the storage folder will be set for you automatically when HexScape is loaded.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set_storage_folder(Sys.getenv("HEXSCAPE_STORAGE"))
unlink(path_to_folder, recursive=TRUE)
```

## Corine data

HexScape uses Corine Land Cover (CLC) data as the raw underlying data for land usage.  To use this, you need to download the SQLite Database from here:  https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018?tab=download

You will first need to register an account and log in, but it is free to do so.

Once the file has downloaded (beware:  it is 3.5GB) you can un-zip it and hopefully end up with a folder named u2018_clc2018_v2020_20u1_geoPackage - move (or copy/symlink if you prefer) this folder inside the raw_data folder that you set up above.  Make sure to keep the name of the folder exactly as it is above.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
