## TODO


Software side:
- Corine land use data (Europe)
- NUTS codes/shapefiles
- DK sogne/kommune/postcodes
- Landscape discretisation
- Reshuffling/anonymisation of spatial locations based on current code only, i.e. re-sampling within 5 nearest neighbours, but with a check to make sure that any locations that are not also nearest neighbours for a minimum of 3 others get auto-removed/warned/swapped
